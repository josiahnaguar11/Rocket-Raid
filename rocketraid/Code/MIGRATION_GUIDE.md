## 📋 What's New

### New Component Architecture
- **HealthComponent**: Optimized health system with events
- **TeamComponent**: Comprehensive team management
- **CurrencyComponent**: Currency and experience system  
- **PlayerComponent**: Enhanced player logic (replaces SnotPlayerComponent)
- **UnitComponentNew**: Backwards-compatible bridge component

### Key Improvements
- ✅ **Performance**: Event-driven updates instead of every-frame polling
- ✅ **Scalability**: Modular components for easy feature additions
- ✅ **Networking Ready**: Foundation for proper multiplayer sync
- ✅ **Future-Proof**: Ready for abilities, advanced teams, economy

## 📦 Component Breakdown

### 1. HealthComponent
**Replaces**: Health logic in UnitComponent  
**Features**:
- Event system (`OnHealthChanged`, `OnDeath`, `OnRevive`)
- Optimized animations (no more every-frame updates)
- Proper async patterns
- Network-ready structure

**Properties**:
```csharp
[Property] public float MaxHealth { get; set; } = 100f;
[Property] public float HealthRegeneration { get; set; } = 0f;
[Property] public SkinnedModelRenderer ModelRenderer { get; set; }
public bool Alive { get; set; } = true;
public float Health { get; private set; }
```

### 2. TeamComponent  
**Replaces**: Team logic in UnitComponent  
**Features**:
- Advanced team management
- Enemy detection methods
- Team switching with events
- Visual team effects

**Teams Available**:
- `TeamType.Player` - Human players
- `TeamType.Enemy` - AI enemies (replaces old "Snot" team)
- `TeamType.Neutral` - NPCs, turrets, etc.

**Key Methods**:
```csharp
team.ChangeTeam(TeamType.Enemy);
team.IsSameTeam(otherTeam);
team.IsEnemyOf(otherTeam);
team.GetTeammates();
team.GetEnemies();
```

```

### 4. PlayerComponent
**Replaces**: SnotPlayerComponent  
**Features**:
- Integration with new components
- Automatic XP/coin rewards for actions
- Enhanced combat system
- Better respawn handling

**Reward System**:
- Rocket redirection: +10 XP
- Dealing damage: +5 XP  
- Killing enemy: +25 XP + 10 coins

### 5. UnitComponentNew
**Purpose**: Backwards compatibility bridge  
**Features**:
- Legacy API support
- Auto-creates new components
- Gradual migration path

## 🛠️ Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup Your Project
```bash
# Create a backup of your current project
# Test the new components in a separate branch
```

### Step 2: Add New Components to Prefabs

#### For Player Prefabs:
1. Add `PlayerComponent` (can coexist with `SnotPlayerComponent`)
2. Add `HealthComponent`  
3. Add `TeamComponent`
4. Add `CurrencyComponent`
5. Configure properties and references

#### For Enemy/NPC Prefabs:
1. Add `UnitComponentNew` or individual components
2. Add `HealthComponent`
3. Add `TeamComponent`
4. Configure team as `TeamType.Enemy` or `TeamType.Neutral`

### Step 3: Update Team References
**Old**: `TeamType.Snot`  
**New**: `TeamType.Enemy`

**Search and replace in your code**:
- `TeamType.Snot` → `TeamType.Enemy`
- `Team == TeamType.Snot` → `Team == TeamType.Enemy`

### Step 4: Update Code References

#### Health System:
```csharp
// Old
unitComponent.Damage(10f);
unitComponent.Health = 50f;

// New  
healthComponent.Damage(10f);
healthComponent.SetHealth(50f);
```

#### Team System:
```csharp
// Old
if (unit1.Team == unit2.Team) return;

// New
if (teamComponent1.IsSameTeam(teamComponent2)) return;
```

### Step 5: Subscribe to Events (Optional)
```csharp
// Health events
healthComponent.OnHealthChanged += OnPlayerHealthChanged;
healthComponent.OnDeath += OnPlayerDied;

// Team events  
teamComponent.OnTeamChanged += OnPlayerTeamChanged;

// Currency events
currencyComponent.OnLevelUp += OnPlayerLevelUp;
currencyComponent.OnCoinsChanged += OnCoinsUpdated;
```

### Step 6: Remove Old Components (When Ready)
1. Test thoroughly with new components
2. Remove old `SnotPlayerComponent` 
3. Replace `UnitComponent` with `UnitComponentNew`
4. Update any remaining code references

## 🎯 Prefab Setup Examples

### Player Prefab Setup:
```
Player GameObject
├── PlayerComponent
│   ├── Controller: PlayerController
│   ├── ModelRenderer: SkinnedModelRenderer  
│   ├── HealthComponent: HealthComponent
│   ├── TeamComponent: TeamComponent
│   └── CurrencyComponent: CurrencyComponent
├── HealthComponent
│   ├── MaxHealth: 100
│   ├── HealthRegeneration: 0
│   └── ModelRenderer: SkinnedModelRenderer
├── TeamComponent  
│   ├── Team: Player
│   ├── TeamName: "Players"
│   ├── TeamColor: Blue
│   └── ModelRenderer: SkinnedModelRenderer
└── CurrencyComponent

    ├── Experience: 0
    └── Level: 1
```

### Enemy Prefab Setup:

├── HealthComponent
│   ├── MaxHealth: 50
│   ├── HealthRegeneration: 5
│   └── ModelRenderer: SkinnedModelRenderer
└── TeamComponent

    ├── TeamName: "Enemies"  
    ├── TeamColor: Red
    └── ModelRenderer: SkinnedModelRenderer
```

## 🔧 Code Examples

### Event Handling:
```csharp
public class GameUI : Component
{
    private HealthComponent playerHealth;
    private CurrencyComponent playerCurrency;
    
    protected override void OnStart()
    {
        // Find player components
        var player = Scene.GetAllComponents<PlayerComponent>().First();
        playerHealth = player.HealthComponent;
        playerCurrency = player.CurrencyComponent;
        
        // Subscribe to events
        playerHealth.OnHealthChanged += UpdateHealthBar;
        playerCurrency.OnCoinsChanged += UpdateCoinDisplay;
        playerCurrency.OnLevelUp += ShowLevelUpEffect;
    }
    
    private void UpdateHealthBar(HealthComponent health, float oldHP, float newHP)
    {
        // Update UI health bar
        var percentage = health.HealthPercentage;
        // Update health bar UI...
    }
    
    private void UpdateCoinDisplay(CurrencyComponent currency, int oldCoins, int newCoins)
    {
        // Update coin counter UI
        // coinLabel.Text = $"Coins: {newCoins}";
    }
    
    private void ShowLevelUpEffect(CurrencyComponent currency, int newLevel)
    {
        // Show level up animation
        Log.Info($"LEVEL UP! Now level {newLevel}");
    }
}
```

### Advanced Team Logic:
```csharp
public class TeamManager : Component
{
    public void CheckTeamBalance()
    {
        var playerTeam = Scene.GetAllComponents<TeamComponent>()
            .Where(t => t.Team == TeamType.Player);
            
        var enemyTeam = Scene.GetAllComponents<TeamComponent>()
            .Where(t => t.Team == TeamType.Enemy);
            
        Log.Info($"Teams - Players: {playerTeam.Count()}, Enemies: {enemyTeam.Count()}");
    }
    
    public void SwitchPlayerToEnemyTeam(PlayerComponent player)
    {
        if (player.TeamComponent.IsValid())
        {
            player.TeamComponent.ChangeTeam(TeamType.Enemy);
        }
    }
}
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "TeamType.Snot doesn't exist"
**Solution**: Replace with `TeamType.Enemy`

### Issue: "Component events not firing"
**Solution**: Make sure you're subscribing to events after components are created

### Issue: "Old UnitComponent conflicts"
**Solution**: Use `UnitComponentNew` as a bridge, or remove old component entirely

### Issue: "Health not syncing across clients"  
**Solution**: The new system is ready for networking - implementation depends on your networking setup
